        <h1>PWA Main Characteristics</h1>
        <p>
            A Progressive Web App (AKA PWA), is a web application that offers an app like experience, like native apps, straight from the web. Unlike traditional web applications, PWAs are designed to be responsive, reliable, fast, and installable on any device, providing an enhanced user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most prominant capability is the ability to download and install the PWA onto your computer. This is done through a manifest file that provides instructions for what files to download. The other is being able to use the webapp offline, and this is done through service workers and file caching. PWAs also make use of push notifications, just like native apps, and they are received even if the PWA is not open in the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, PWAs are designed to be responsive and adaptable to any screen size. This means that they can be used on any device, whether smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Additionally, PWAs are fast, providing quick load times and smooth transitions between pages. All of these are factors for a great user experience.
